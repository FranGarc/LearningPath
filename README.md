# LearningPath

The intend behind this repository is to help guide a developer who wants to learn Android to have one path to follow in their learning.

While there's code in this repository, the core idea is in its wiki: a series of "lessons" that will guide the developer to create a working app. Each "lesson" will be the basis for the next one, but each deals with its own tasks and topics.

We will use the more modern (at time of writing) elements of Android like Jetpack Compose or Flow, and common ones like Retrofit and Coil libraries, MVVM pattern, very basic topics of Clean Architecture.

You are expected to have at least a basic grasp of kotlin, and a working Android Studio.

Following this WIP project you will create a Proof of Concept (the main objective is to learn how to use different technical topics) app that will consume [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) if only to give it a bit of whimsy and fun to the learning process. Feel free to adapt the lessons so they will fit with a different API you may prefer.

## Path Structure

The development of this simple app will be done in discrete "lessons". Each lesson should cover one topic to focus on. The process is learning by doing, so each lesson will require to perform a task, with some hints to be followed. Also, each lesson will contain a list of terms that the student may
need to look up to finish the lesson.

The lesson statements can be found in this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/FranGarc/LearningPath/wiki/Learning-Path).

The Lessons won't actually "teach" in the lecture sense. The structure includes the topic/s the lesson will be all about; the tasks to be completed; Tips & Advice with generic hints; They do have some advice, a list of Research Terms that will help when looking up how to do the task and also what to look for if you want to deepen your understanding of them.
